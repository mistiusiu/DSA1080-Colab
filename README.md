# DSA1080 Spring Semester 2024 Projects
This repo contains in folders the various group projects collaborated on during the semester. It also is the first repository where team members experimented with the features of git. A brief run thorugh of git features is at the bottom.

## Data Types and Simple Manipulations
This is the code written in Python files that encompasses:
- Handling lists
- Handling tuples
- List slicing
- Combining lists and tuples

## Git Crash Course
To add files to commit use the `git add` command:

```bash
$ git add .
# It will include all modified files in the current working directory
```

To give the commit a custom message use `git commit`:

```bash
$ git commit -m "First commit"
# It will give the current commit the message 'First commit'
```

To upload a commit to Github use `git push`:

```bash
$ git push
# It will push all pending commits to Github
```

To retrieve the recent changes made by another collaborator use `git pull`:

```bash
$ git pull
# It will get all recent changes
```

To check who pushed code that broke the application or a feature use `git blame`:

```bash
$ git blame
# It will return the last commits to simplify the blame game
```

### Configurations
#### Windows
Feel free to either use **Github Desktop** or the **Github CLI**. Using the desktop is the most simple method as it makes commiting and pulling commits to be at the tap of a button. Most Windows users never see powershell or the command line so stick with the desktop. Moreover, it is really underpowered with contrast to the Unix terminal.

#### MacOS
Feel free Feel free to either use **Github Desktop** or the **Github CLI**. Using the desktop is the most simple method as it makes commiting and pulling commits to be at the tap of a button. MacOS is fancy Unix without the flexibility thus one may have to install Homebrew. If you have no idea what that is stick with the desktop.s

### Linux / Ubuntu
Using the terminal is a really pretty thing to do. Nonetheless, you can also use **Github Desktop**.
